# FreeNAS

WARNING: FreeNAS is for advanced users only.  If you are not very comfortable with UNIX-like command line usage, I would suggest using Debian, Ubuntu, CentOS, or Arch instead of FreeNAS.

FreeNAS is a UNIX distro built for network storage solutions that you can install for free.

A client uses FreeNAS so I have started teaching myself.  These are notes as I am learning.  Much of my GNU/Linux knowledge carries over, but there are plenty of differences.  If you see I have made a mistake or know of a better way of doing things, add an issue to the SetupNotes repository or send me an email.

I found the installation of FreeNAS to be extremely easy compared to other GNU/Linux and UNIX distros.

Set the BIOS to legacy mode.

Boot from FreeNAS installation media.
