# Add drive to fstab manually

I often find myself trying to set a drive to automatically boot on a system.

This lists the drives by uuid:
ls -la /dev/disk/by-uuid/

Find the one you want and complete the ls entry using tab completion

ls -la /dev/disk/by-uuid/926c2f9e-239d-4f4b-8bfd-f937f0de253f

As root, remove the first part and replace it with echo and append it to the /etc/fstab file.

echo 926c2f9e-239d-4f4b-8bfd-f937f0de253f >> /etc/fstab

Edit /etc/fstab:

nano /etc/fstab

Modify the line to look like this:
UUID=926c2f9e-239d-4f4b-8bfd-f937f0de253f /mnt/desiredtmountpoint      ext4    defaults        0       2

Change desired mountpoint to that of your chosing.
